Q1:	-Duplicated code
	-Duplicated expressions in the same class
	-Can be refactored by wrapping repeated code into a method that can be run. (Extract method)

Q3:	-This method really doesn't belong to the Nodes class
	-Feature envy
	-Moving this method to the class that it invokes
	-Makes more sense to have Jenkins class have this method and just have nodes invoke the method from jenkins class

Q4:	-Repeated code inside of the same method
	-Wrap the repeated code into a loop
	-Add break flag to allow break inside loop to actually break the intended loop

Q6:	-Duplicated code was found inside to two methods in the same test class
	-Wrap duplicated code into a new method and have each class just call this method
